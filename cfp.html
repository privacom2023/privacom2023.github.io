    <h3>Call for Papers</h3> 

<p align="justify">
Securely and privately managing sensitive user data is of tremendous importance in fostering and encouraging the development of new types of pervasive applications and services that are currently unthinkable.
However, collected data can be analyzed to reveal sensitive information that users would be unwilling to share if they were aware of the consequences. It is thus critical to design innovative privacy-preserving applications and techniques that are able to operate while preserving the confidentiality of sensitive information.
The design and widespread adoption of novel privacy-preserving data analysis techniques would also have significant socio-economic implications, since it would allow users' sensitive data to be handled explicitly and remain secret throughout all processing phases, instead of sidestepping the privacy issue altogether by collecting as little information as possible.
</p>
<p align="justify">The First Workshop on Privacy Preserving Computation in Pervasive Computing (PrivaCom 2023) will provide a forum to discuss, exchange insights and share experiences among researchers, industry specialists and application developers.
</p>
<p align="justify">Authors are kindly invited to submit original research on both theoretical and practical aspects of privacy-preserving computation for pervasive computing.
We especially welcome submissions that present implementation and
deployment results. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:
          <ul>
            <li> 
              Privacy-preserving systems and applications
            </li>
            <li> 
              Privacy sensing and sharing
            </li>

<strong>PAPER SUBMISSION</strong><br />

Papers should contain original material and not be previously published,
or currently submitted for consideration elsewhere.
</p>
<p align="left">
Papers must be submitted in PDF format.<br />
Maximum length: 6 pages (including references).<br />
Papers must be prepared using the template available here: <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank" >https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>
</p>
<p align="justify">All submissions will be handled via EDAS.<br />
Accepted papers will be indexed and made available as part of the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and will be included in the PerCom 2023 workshops proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register and attend the workshop to present the paper. There is no workshop-only registration. Failure to present the paper at the workshop will result in the withdrawal of the paper from the Proceedings as well as from IEEE Xplore.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Important Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submission deadline: November 14, 2022</li>
<li>Notification of acceptance: January 05, 2023</li>
<li>Deadline for camera ready papers: TBA</strong></li>
